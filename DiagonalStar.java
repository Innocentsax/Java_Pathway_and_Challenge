/* Diagonal Star
Write a method named printSquareStar with one parameter of type int named number. 

If number is < 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".

The method should print diagonals to generate a rectangular pattern composed of stars (*). This should be accomplished by using loops (see examples below).



EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

EXAMPLE 1

printSquareStar(5); should print the following:

→ NOTE: For text in Code Blocks below, use code icon {...}  on Udemy

*****
** **
* * *
** **
*****

Explanation:

*****   5 stars
** **   2 stars space 2 stars
* * *   1 star space 1 star space 1 star
** **   2 stars space 2 stars
*****   5 stars


EXAMPLE 2

printSquareStar(8); should print the following:

********
**    **
* *  * *
*  **  *
*  **  *
* *  * *
**    **
********


The patterns above consist of a number of rows and columns (where number is the number of rows to print). For each row or column, stars are printed based on four conditions (Read them carefully):

In the first or last row

In the first or last column

When the row number equals the column number

When the column number equals rowCount - currentRow + 1 (where currentRow is current row number)



HINT: Use a nested loop (a loop inside of a loop).

HINT: To print on the same line, use the print method instead of println, e.g. System.out.print(" "); prints a space and does not "move" to another line.

HINT: To "move" to another line, you can use an empty println call, e.g. System.out.println(); .

NOTE: The method printSquareStar ​should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.*/
