  /*  All Factors
    Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number.

        If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value".

        The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides that number wholly (i.e. without leaving a remainder).

        For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.



        EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

        printFactors(6); → should print 1 2 3 6

        printFactors(32); → should print 1 2 4 8 16 32

        printFactors(10); → should print 1 2 5 10

        printFactors(-1); → should print "Invalid Value" since number is < 1



        HINT: Use a while or for loop.



        NOTE: When printing numbers, each number can be in its own line. They don't have to be separated by a space.

        For example, the printout for printFactors(10); can be:

        1
        2
        5
        10
        NOTE: The method printFactors​ should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

        NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.*/
