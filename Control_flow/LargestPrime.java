/*Largest Prime
Write a method named getLargestPrime with one parameter of type int named number. 

If the number is negative or does not have any prime numbers, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.



The method should calculate the largest prime factor of a given number and return it.



EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

getLargestPrime (21); should return 7 since 7 is the largest prime (3 * 7 = 21)

getLargestPrime (217); should return 31 since 31 is the largest prime (7 * 31 = 217)

getLargestPrime (0); should return -1 since 0 does not have any prime numbers

getLargestPrime (45); should return 5 since 5 is the largest prime (3 * 3 * 5 = 45)

getLargestPrime (-1); should return -1 since the parameter is negative



HINT: Since the numbers 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers, they cannot contain prime numbers.

NOTE: The method getLargestPrime â€‹should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.*/
