/*Perfect Number
What is the perfect number?
A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. 
Proper positive divisors are positive integers that fully divide the perfect number without leaving a remainder and exclude the perfect number itself.
For example, take the number 6: 
Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3 (since 6 is the value of the perfect number, it is excluded), and the sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 

Therefore, 6 is a perfect number (as well as the first perfect number).



Write a method named isPerfectNumber with one parameter of type int named number. 

If number is < 1, the method should return false.

The method must calculate if the number is perfect. If the number is perfect, the method should return true; otherwise, it should return false.



EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

isPerfectNumber(6); should return true since its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 and the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

isPerfectNumber(28); should return true since its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28

isPerfectNumber(5); should return false since its only proper divisor is 1 and the sum is 1 not 5

isPerfectNumber(-1); should return false since the number is < 1



HINT: Use a while or for loop.

HINT: Use the remainder operator.

NOTE: The method isPerfectNumber â€‹should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.*/
