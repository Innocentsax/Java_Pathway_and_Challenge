/*Sum Calculator
Write a class with the name SimpleCalculator. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with names firstNumber and secondNumber both of type double.

Write the following methods (instance methods):

Method named getFirstNumber without any parameters, it needs to return the value of firstNumber field.

Method named getSecondNumber without any parameters, it needs to return the value of secondNumber field.

Method named setFirstNumber with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the firstNumber field.

Method named setSecondNumber with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the secondNumberfield.

Method named getAdditionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of adding the field values of firstNumber and secondNumber.

Method named getSubtractionResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of subtracting the field values of secondNumber from the firstNumber.

Method named getMultiplicationResult without any parameters, it needs to return the result of multiplying the field values of firstNumber and secondNumber.

Method named getDivisionResult without any parameters it needs to return the result of dividing the field values of firstNumber by the secondNumber. In case the value of secondNumber is 0 then return 0.



TEST EXAMPLE

TEST CODE:

SimpleCalculator calculator = new SimpleCalculator();
calculator.setFirstNumber(5.0);
calculator.setSecondNumber(4);
System.out.println("add= " + calculator.getAdditionResult());
System.out.println("subtract= " + calculator.getSubtractionResult());
calculator.setFirstNumber(5.25);
calculator.setSecondNumber(0);
System.out.println("multiply= " + calculator.getMultiplicationResult());
System.out.println("divide= " + calculator.getDivisionResult());
OUTPUT

add= 9.0
subtract= 1.0
multiply= 0.0
divide= 0.0
TIPS:

add= 9.0 is printed because 5.0 + 4 is 9.0

subtract= 1.0 is printed because 5.0 - 4 is 1.0

multiply= 0.0 is printed because 5.25 * 0 is 0.0

divide= 0.0 is printed because secondNumber is set to 0



NOTE: All â€‹methods should be defined as public NOT public static.

NOTE: In total, you have to write 8 methods.

NOTE: Do not add the main method to the solution code.*/
