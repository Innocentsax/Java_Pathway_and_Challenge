    /*Shared Digit
    Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.

        Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.

        The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.



        EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

        hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in both numbers

        hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range of 10-99

        hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in both numbers



        NOTE: The method hasSharedDigit​ should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

        NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.*/
